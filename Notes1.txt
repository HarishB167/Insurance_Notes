- 3 Stages in Life
1. Childhood
2. Adulthood
Reckless and full of emotion
Career and earning
Get power of freedom
Take new responsibility, with assumption of not
being jobless and not facing early death
Analyze how much savings you have and for 
how much time your family can survive by that money.
3. Elderhood
No requirement of Life insurance after age 70-75.
As children are not dependent on you.


- Problems
* Most probabley cheated by insurance sellers
* Insurance company are infamous
* Lot of miss-selling by agents

- Who needs Life insurance
• You might/already have dependents
• You have liabilities (loans)

- Ideal Life Insurance Cover
• Should cover existing liabilities
• Should sustain family lifestyle (15-20 years)
• Should beat inflation
• Ideal amount should be = 20 x yearly salary
• Should reassess at major events and increase cover if required
Events like - Marriage, children, promotion, loans
• How to increase some plans, example
Some plans has - on wedding can increase by 50% and on child 25%
Some plans has 5% every year till it doubles
Or buy another policy for additional amount
• Term Insurance = best insurance = cheap insurance
Money is given during cover, if death afer duration than no money.
• Never mix insurance and investments.

- Why Cheapest
• Cheaper at low age.
• Premium never changes.

- Time Value Of Money
• If 1 lac given today instead of 10 years later can be invested and can get
3 lac if interest was 12% yearly (which is normal).

- Why not whole life insurance
• It is costly
• Additional money (e.g. 6000) if invested will give 2 crore after retirement.

- Term Insurance
• Cheapest Life Insurance
• Best Life Insurance
• Less Premium at Younger Age
• Fixed Premium

- Adequate Term
• Till age of 65
• But sometimes premium difference between 65 and 75 age is very less
so can take 75 age premium. So when difference is only 10 to 20 rupees
then can take of 75 age plan.

- How to select best company?
• Long-term surviver
• Brand Value (company has something to loose)
• Claim settlement ratio
• CSR by Amount (shows reality)
• Claim Repudiation Ratio (18:00)
how many claims company has rejected
should be looked with CSR by Amount
• Assets Under Management
High AUM = Better
• Thumb rule - can choose any in top 5 companies.
• Riders (addons)
1. Critical Illness Rider - will get total amount on critical illness
2. Accidental Disability Rider
• Hidden terms
1. Rider being part of policy cover, i.e., can reduce the term insurance amount.
Partial disability of full disability
2. Focus not on numbers of illness but on 10-12 illness which are
common to indians.
• Ask questions on call of policy bazar. (22:00)
about riders, cover being part of term insurance amount or different

- Premium payment options
1. Return of premium
Targets your greed. Increase your premium so that premium will
be returned at end of term. Avoid it.
2. Limited pay
Increase your premium so that you need to pay premium for less duration 
10 years. Avoid it.
3. Zero cost term insurance
Increase you premium so that you cancel insurance at early age (60) and all
premium will be returned. Avoid it. (If premium is same to normal, then
can take)

- How to avoid claim rejection?
• Be honest - tell all your diseases.
• Assume the worst. (28:00)
• You have to request, don't take medical test on telephone, and
sent someone at home to take medical test (so that if unknown
disease is their it can be found) and decide premium on that test.
• Whenever you go to hospital, for any health problem, maintain
all your health records. This will help your family after your death
so that they can show that this new illness happened after taking
term insurance.
• Record Everything : 
At time of claim, when some person comes to investigate then
record everything. (as they can request bribery).
• Problem 1 
Unclaimed money (insurance, mutual funds, bank account)
Family member should know and have documents, share also online
credentials (nsdl digital site, drive etc).
Tell also about insurance company, and this site or number will be used
to make first call for insurance claim.
• Problem 2
We don't know what to do with this big amount. Specially family members.
Monthly payout is bad decision.
Do FD and take interest yearly.
Educate family about how to invest this.
